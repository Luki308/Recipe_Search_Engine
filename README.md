This app allows user to search for a meal ideas, keep track of products available in home or create shopping lists.

My work focused mostly on Search Panel.

You can search recipes by text you write or by ingredients you want to use. Then you can choose number of recipes that you want to find and the app looks for them using [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). You can click on images to change recipe shown on the right side.

More screenshots of the app available in file [Podsumowanie_projektu](https://github.com/Luki308/Recipe_Search_Engine/blob/main/Podsumowanie_projektu_ZPOIF.pdf)
